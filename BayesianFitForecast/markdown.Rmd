# Overview


```{r}
# This folder contains multiple pre-configured option files, 
# providing users with the flexibility to select and utilize any of them as 
# needed.
# Specifically, this option file is designed for general use, 
# allowing users to work seamlessly with their own models alongside the other 
# available options.
# It is recommended to review the tutorial before using this file to maximize
# its effectiveness.


# Set the calibration periods for the model.
# These are specified as a numeric vector, with each element 
# representing a distinct period (in this case, 17 and 18) 
# used for calibrating the model's parameters.

# Set the forecasting horizon for the model.
# This value indicates the number of time steps (in this case, 10) 
# into the future for which predictions will be made.

# Define the names of the state variables for the SEIR model.
# These variables represent the different compartments in the model:

# "I" for infected individuals, 
# "R" for recovered individuals, 
# and "C" for cumulative cases.

# Define the model parameters as a vector.
# Each parameter plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the SEIR model:
#
# - beta: the transmission rate of the disease, with an expected range of 
# (0, 10).
# - gamma: the recovery rate of infected individuals, with an expected range of
# (0, 10).
# - kappa: the incubation rate, representing the rate at which exposed 
# individuals become infected,
#   with an expected range of (0, 10).
# - rho: the recovery proportion rate, indicating the fraction of infected 
# individuals that recover,
#   with an expected range of (0, 1).
# - N: the total population size (not explicitly defined in the example).
# - i0: the initial number of infected individuals (not explicitly defined in
# the example).

# The equations utilize the following parameters:
# - params1: Transmission-related parameter influencing S and E.
# - params2: Recovery-related parameter influencing I and R.
# - params3: Rate of exposure influencing E and I.
# - params4: Affects the cumulative cases.
# - params5: Total population size, impacting the transmission dynamics.

# User-defined priors for each model parameter.

# representing a multiplicative process.
#   - Exponential distribution: "exponential(1)" - Useful for modeling rates,

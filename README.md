# BayesianFitForecast

**BayesianFitForecast** is an R toolbox designed to streamline Bayesian parameter estimation and forecasting in ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, making advanced Bayesian methods more accessible across a variety of scientific disciplines. This toolbox automates the generation of Stan files, enabling users to configure models, define priors, and analyze results efficiently with minimal programming expertise.

## Features

- **Automated Stan File Generation**: Automatically generate Stan files based on user-defined ODE models.
- **Bayesian Parameter Estimation**: Estimate model parameters using Bayesian inference, incorporating uncertainty and prior knowledge.
- **Model Performance Evaluation**: Includes robust tools for evaluating model performance, such as convergence diagnostics, posterior distributions, credible intervals, and various performance metrics.
- **Versatility**: Applicable to a wide range of scientific fields, with demonstrated use cases including the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco.
- **Tutorial Resources**: Includes a detailed tutorial and a video guide to help users get started with the toolbox.

# BayesianFitForecast

**BayesianFitForecast** is an R toolbox designed to streamline Bayesian parameter estimation and forecasting in ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, making advanced Bayesian methods more accessible across a variety of scientific disciplines. This toolbox automates the generation of Stan files, enabling users to configure models, define priors, and analyze results efficiently with minimal programming expertise.

## Features

- **Automated Stan File Generation**: Automatically generate Stan files based on user-defined ODE models.
- **Bayesian Parameter Estimation**: Estimate model parameters using Bayesian inference, incorporating uncertainty and prior knowledge.
- **Model Performance Evaluation**: Includes robust tools for evaluating model performance, such as convergence diagnostics, posterior distributions, credible intervals, and various performance metrics.
- **Versatility**: Applicable to a wide range of scientific fields, with demonstrated use cases including the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco.
- **Tutorial Resources**: Includes a detailed tutorial and a video guide to help users get started with the toolbox.

## Usage

### 1. Configuring Your Model

Start by defining your ODE model, parameters, and priors in the `options_generaluse.R` file. This file will allow you to specify the model variables, parameters, error structures, and priors.

### 2. Running the Model

After configuring your model, use the `run_MCMC.R` script to fit the model to your data. This script will perform the Bayesian parameter estimation using the Stan files generated by the toolbox.

### 3. Analyzing Results

Once the model fitting is complete, use the `run_analyzeResults.R` script to generate and analyze the results. This script will produce various outputs, including Excel files with the parameter estimates, performance metrics, and convergence diagnostics.

### 4. Example Use Case

For a demonstration of the toolboxâ€™s capabilities, refer to the example provided in the repository, which analyzes the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco using the SEIR model.
